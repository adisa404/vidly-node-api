log module object to see the properties

vars and functions are scoped to a module, unless we export it
and make it available outside of thius module

## load module

use require function
require('./logger')

first log the return value of the require function:
logger { log: [Function: log] }

but we can also export like this
module.exports = log;

now log is accessible as a function
